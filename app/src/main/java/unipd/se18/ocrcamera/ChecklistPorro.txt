Codereview's checklist:
	-Does the code respect the style guide?
	-Is the code easy to read?
	-Are there enough comments?
	-Does the method respect the specs?
	-Is the method's name appropriate?
	-Is it possible to divide the main method to make easier the tests?
	-Are the desing patterns well used?
	-Are the access modifiers right?
	-Does the variable's names reflect their role in the code?
	-Are the exceptions well managed?
	-When a code returns a number is it possible to use an enum class?
	-Is there any harcoding?

These are the main things I've checked while I do the reviews. I've also checked if there were
a way to improve the code.
