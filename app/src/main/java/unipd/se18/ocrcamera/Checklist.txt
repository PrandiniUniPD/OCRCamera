Codereview checklist:

	- The specs sum up what the code does (input, output, modifications)
	- The code logic is clean and correct
	- The code is well commented and the comments are explanatory
	- The variables/method's names are appropriate
	- The methods are not too dense of functions and the number of lines is not too high
	  (according with the context)
	- The access modifiers are appropriate
	- The classes and method's architecture is modular
	- The number of global variables is minimum
	- The variables have the optimal scope
	- The method's signature has the minimum number of parameters
	- The data structures used are appropriate
	- All the execution flows are considered and properly managed
	- The exceptions are properly catched (without being generic) and properly handled
	- The method's limit cases are opportunely handled (according with the specifications)
	
Over than highlighting these principles, I've tried to suggest any possible alternative solution
for the reviewed code, in order to share other possible solutions or code structures.
