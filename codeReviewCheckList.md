# Code review check list:
- The code must follow the style document such as:
   - naming convention (e.g. UpperCamelCase for classes and lowerCamelCase for variables)
   - formatting
   - javadoc formatting
- Write useful comments
- Specifications must be written (input, output, modifications)
- Use meaningful and explanatory names (classes, methods, variables...)
- Proper code modularity: methods shoudn't be too long
- All exceptions are catched and properly handled
- Avoid hard coding 
- Encapsulate as much as possible by:
  - avoiding global variables when possible
  - using appropriate access modifiers
